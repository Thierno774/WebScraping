## About

CellO (Cell Ontology-based classification) is a Python package for performing cell type classification of human RNA-seq data. CellO makes hierarchical predictions against the [Cell Ontology]([http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html](https://lesjeudis.com/en)). These classifiers were trained on nearly all of the human primary cell, bulk RNA-seq data in the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

For more details regarding the underlying method, see the paper:
[Bernstein, M.N., Ma, J., Gleicher, M., Dewey, C.N. (2020). CellO: Comprehensive and hierarchical cell type classification of human cellswith the Cell Ontology. *iScience*, 24(1), 101913.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258900422031110X) 

There are two modes in which one can use CellO: within Python in conjunction with [Scanpy](), or with the command line.
